                    <p>📅 02-03-2025 👉 -  💫 Our Beginning 💫

                        A reply to her story, a chat about coding…
                        Minutes turned to hours, words turned to feelings,
                        And before we knew it—3 AM, and a story that never ends. ❤️✨ 🤝<br></p>
                   
                   <p>📅  03-03-2025 👉 The day after tomorrow, she missed me at college, and I missed her too.
                    We talked about our late-night conversation…
                    The feeling was different—warm, special.
                    And then, we said "I love you." ❤️✨ 🌃<br></p>

                      <p>📅  04-03-2025 👉 She changed my name on Instagram—
                        not just any name, but one with her birthday month.
                        
                        A small change, yet it meant the world to me.
                        It felt special, like I was a part of her in a way words couldn’t explain.
                        And in that moment, I smiled…  because I belonged to her. ❤️✨ ❤️✨ 💋<br></p>

                        <p>📅  05-03-2025 👉  The day felt incomplete without her.
                            She missed me, and I missed her even more.
                            Our words from last night echoed in my heart,
                            pulling me closer to something undeniable.
                            And then, with a glance, with a touch, we finally said it—
                            "I love you." ❤️ 👫<br></p>
                    <p>📅   06-03-2025 👉  -  We started our conversation in VC—
                        her voice, soft and warm, felt like home.
                        
                        Minutes turned into hours, laughter into memories,
                        and with every word, I felt closer to her.
                        It wasn’t just a call; it was the beginning of something beautiful. ❤️✨ 😘🎬<br></p>
                        
                    <p>📅   07-03-2025 👉 -  We started sharing our feelings,
                        opening up like pages of a book only we could read.
                        
                        From dreams to fears, from laughter to silence—
                        we spoke about everything, even family.
                        
                        With every word, we weren’t just talking…
                        we were falling. ❤️✨ ❤️<br></p>
                        
                    <p>📅  08-03-2025 👉   Sometimes, we argue, emotions run high…
                        but no matter how stormy the moment, we can’t stay apart for long.
                        
                        Because souls meant to be will always find their way back—
                        and we always do. ❤️✨😗<br></p>

                        <p>📅  09-03-2025 👉  Whenever she had a fever, I couldn’t rest.
                            I checked on her again and again, making sure she was okay.
                            
                            Her warmth wasn’t just from the fever—it was the way she made my heart feel.
                            Because when you truly love someone, their pain feels like yours. ❤️‍🩹✨  
                        ❤️✨😗<br></p>

                     
                    
                    <p>📅 10-03-2025 👉 we plan "No matter where life takes us, no matter the storms we face—our hearts will always find their way back to each other. Some love stories never end, and ours is one of them.

                        We dream, we plan, we build a future in whispered promises—
                        A home filled with love, laughter, and forever." ❤️✨  🎂🎈<br></p>
